A plugin to include the Magnific Popup lightbox for single & gallery images in WordPress.

== Description ==

This simple plugin has no options (yet), install, activate and forget. It currently support single images in posts and pages, and gallery images using the built-in WordPress Gallery shortcode. 
Images within a Gallery will have next and previous arrows.
You can add an alt attribute to your image, to enable lightbox 'captions'.
