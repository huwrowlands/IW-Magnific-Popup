A plugin to include the Magnific Popup lightbox for single & gallery images in WordPress.

== Description ==

This basic plugin enables the Magnific Popup image lightbox to work with single images within your posts and pages, gallery images using the built-in WordPress gallery and also WooCommerce product images. 
Images within a Gallery will have next and previous arrows.
You can add an alt attribute to your image, to enable lightbox 'captions'.

The plugin comes with a Settings page for you to choose options. All are off by default.
