A plugin to include the Magnific Popup lightbox for single & gallery images in WordPress.

== Description ==

This simple plugin has no options (yet), install, activate and forget. It currently support single images in posts and pages, and gallery images using the built-in WordPress Gallery shortcode. 
Images within a Gallery will have next and previous arrows.
You can add an alt attribute to your image, to enable lightbox 'captions'.

Thanks to Dmitry Semenov for the original script and hard work: http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/

Note: This only supports images and not the full capabilities of Magnific Popup.
